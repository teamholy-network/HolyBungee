TeamHoly.NET BungeeCord
=======================
Layer 7 proxy designed to link Minecraft servers.
--------------------------------------------------

This version of BungeeCord is specifically modified for the [TeamHoly.NET](https://teamholy.net) network. BungeeCord is a powerful proxy and API designed to teleport players between multiple Minecraft servers seamlessly. It is the latest evolution of similar software maintained by the author from 2011 to the present.

Information
-----------
TeamHoly.NET BungeeCord is based on the original project, maintained by [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/). For detailed information and discussions, please refer to the [official BungeeCord thread](https://www.spigotmc.org/go/bungeecord).

### Security Warning

Since Minecraft servers within a BungeeCord network must run without authentication (online-mode=false), this introduces a new security risk. Users may connect directly to your servers using any username. The warning "If you wish to use IP forwarding, please enable it in your BungeeCord config as well!" does not fully protect your Spigot servers.

To prevent unauthorized access, you should restrict access to these servers, for example, by using a firewall. Please see the [firewall guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/firewall-guide/) for more information.
